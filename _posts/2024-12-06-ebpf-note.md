# BPF verifier failure

## `Global function XXX() doesn't return scalar. Only those are supported.`


# Questions

## Does linux bpf allow to store pointer into map?

No, see [Q: Can BPF programs access instruction pointer or return address?](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/bpf_design_QA.html#q-can-bpf-programs-access-instruction-pointer-or-return-address)

[Long-lived kernel pointers in BPF](https://lwn.net/Articles/900749/)

But kptr annotated with KF_ACQUIRE can be transferred to map, see
`KF_ACQUIRE flag` section of [kernelk funcs doc](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/kfuncs.html)

## how to understand and use kptrs?

## BPF Kernel Functions (kfuncs)

[BPF Kernel Functions (kfuncs)](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/kfuncs.html)


### KF_ACQUIRE flag

> The KF_ACQUIRE flag is used to indicate that the kfunc returns a pointer
> to a refcounted object. The verifier will then ensure that the pointer
> to the object is eventually released using a release kfunc, or transferred
> to a map using a referenced kptr (by invoking bpf_kptr_xchg). If not, the
> verifier fails the loading of the BPF program until no lingering
> references remain in all possible explored states of the program.

Examples:
    - bpf_task_acquire() and bpf_task_release()

    - bpf_task_from_pid()

    - bpf_cgroup_acquire() and bpf_cgroup_release()

    - bpf_cgroup_from_id() and bpf_cgroup_ancestor()

## BPF maps

```
BPF ‘maps’ provide generic storage of different types for sharing data
between kernel and user space. There are several storage types available,
including hash, array, bloom filter and radix-tree. Several of the map
types exist to support specific BPF helpers that perform actions based
on the map contents. The maps are accessed from BPF programs via BPF
helpers which are documented in the man-pages for bpf-helpers(7).

BPF maps are accessed from user space via the bpf syscall, which
provides commands to create maps, lookup elements, update elements and
delete elements. More details of the BPF syscall are available in
ebpf-syscall and in the man-pages for bpf(2).
```

### notes

- bpf map is global,

`bpf(BPF_MAP_CREATE, &attr, sizeof(attr))` returns one file descriptor for
this map.

Every process can access this map, include kernel.


## BTF

[BPF Type Format (BTF)](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/btf.html)

### Introduction

BTF (BPF Type Format) is the metadata format which encodes the debug info
related to BPF program/map. The name BTF was used initially to describe
data types. The BTF was later extended to include function info for
defined subroutines, and line info for source/line information.

The BTF specification contains two parts:

- BTF kernel API

- BTF ELF file format

The kernel API is the contract between user space and kernel. The kernel
verifies the BTF info before using it. The ELF file format is a user space
contract between ELF file and libbpf loader.

The type and string sections are part of the BTF kernel API, describing
the debug info (mostly types related) referenced by the bpf program. 

### BTF Type and String Encoding

- header definition

```
struct btf_header {
    __u16   magic;
    __u8    version;
    __u8    flags;
    __u32   hdr_len;

    /* All offsets are in bytes relative to the end of this header */
    __u32   type_off;       /* offset of type section       */
    __u32   type_len;       /* length of type section       */
    __u32   str_off;        /* offset of string section     */
    __u32   str_len;        /* length of string section     */
};
```

The magic is 0xeB9F.

#### String Encoding

The first string in the string section must be a null string. The rest
of string table is a concatenation of other null-terminated strings.


#### Type Encoding

The type id 0 is reserved for void type. The type section is parsed
sequentially and type id is assigned to each recognized type starting
from id 1. Currently, the following types are supported:

```
#define BTF_KIND_INT            1       /* Integer      */
#define BTF_KIND_PTR            2       /* Pointer      */
#define BTF_KIND_ARRAY          3       /* Array        */
#define BTF_KIND_STRUCT         4       /* Struct       */
#define BTF_KIND_UNION          5       /* Union        */
#define BTF_KIND_ENUM           6       /* Enumeration up to 32-bit values */
#define BTF_KIND_FWD            7       /* Forward      */
#define BTF_KIND_TYPEDEF        8       /* Typedef      */
#define BTF_KIND_VOLATILE       9       /* Volatile     */
#define BTF_KIND_CONST          10      /* Const        */
#define BTF_KIND_RESTRICT       11      /* Restrict     */
#define BTF_KIND_FUNC           12      /* Function     */
#define BTF_KIND_FUNC_PROTO     13      /* Function Proto       */
#define BTF_KIND_VAR            14      /* Variable     */
#define BTF_KIND_DATASEC        15      /* Section      */
#define BTF_KIND_FLOAT          16      /* Floating point       */
#define BTF_KIND_DECL_TAG       17      /* Decl Tag     */
#define BTF_KIND_TYPE_TAG       18      /* Type Tag     */
#define BTF_KIND_ENUM64         19      /* Enumeration up to 64-bit values */
```

Each type contains the following common data:

```
struct btf_type {
    __u32 name_off;
    /* "info" bits arrangement
     * bits  0-15: vlen (e.g. # of struct's members)
     * bits 16-23: unused
     * bits 24-28: kind (e.g. int, ptr, array...etc)
     * bits 29-30: unused
     * bit     31: kind_flag, currently used by
     *             struct, union, fwd, enum and enum64.
     */
    __u32 info;
    /* "size" is used by INT, ENUM, STRUCT, UNION and ENUM64.
     * "size" tells the size of the type it is describing.
     *
     * "type" is used by PTR, TYPEDEF, VOLATILE, CONST, RESTRICT,
     * FUNC, FUNC_PROTO, DECL_TAG and TYPE_TAG.
     * "type" is a type_id referring to another type.
     */
    union {
            __u32 size;
            __u32 type;
    };
};
```

For certain kinds, the common data are followed by kind-specific data.
The name_off in struct btf_type specifies the offset in the string table. 

#### Constant Values


### BTF Kernel API

The following bpf syscall command involves BTF:

- BPF_BTF_LOAD: load a blob of BTF data into kernel

- BPF_MAP_CREATE: map creation with btf key and value type info.

- BPF_PROG_LOAD: prog load with btf function and line info.

- BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID: get a btf fd

- BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD: btf, func_info, line_info and other btf related info are returned.


#### BPF_BTF_LOAD

Load a blob of BTF data into kernel. A blob of data, described in 2.
BTF Type and String Encoding, can be directly loaded into the kernel.
A btf_fd is returned to a userspace.


#### BPF_MAP_CREATE

A map can be created with btf_fd and specified key/value type id.:
```
__u32   btf_fd;         /* fd pointing to a BTF type data */
__u32   btf_key_type_id;        /* BTF type_id of the key */
__u32   btf_value_type_id;      /* BTF type_id of the value */
```

In libbpf, the map can be defined with extra annotation like below:

```
struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY);
    __type(key, int);
    __type(value, struct ipv_counts);
    __uint(max_entries, 4);
} btf_map SEC(".maps");
```

During ELF parsing, libbpf is able to extract key/value type_id’s and
assign them to BPF_MAP_CREATE attributes automatically.

#### BPF_PROG_LOAD

During prog_load, func_info and line_info can be passed to kernel
with proper values for the following attributes:

```
__u32           insn_cnt;
__aligned_u64   insns;
......
__u32           prog_btf_fd;    /* fd pointing to BTF type data */
__u32           func_info_rec_size;     /* userspace bpf_func_info size */
__aligned_u64   func_info;      /* func info */
__u32           func_info_cnt;  /* number of bpf_func_info records */
__u32           line_info_rec_size;     /* userspace bpf_line_info size */
__aligned_u64   line_info;      /* line info */
__u32           line_info_cnt;  /* number of bpf_line_info records */
```

#### BPF_{PROG,MAP}_GET_NEXT_ID

In kernel, every loaded program, map or btf has a unique id. The id won’t
change during the lifetime of a program, map, or btf.

The bpf syscall command BPF_{PROG,MAP}_GET_NEXT_ID returns all id’s, one
for each command, to user space, for bpf program or maps, respectively, so
an inspection tool can inspect all programs and maps.

#### BPF_{PROG,MAP}_GET_FD_BY_ID

An introspection tool cannot use id to get details about program or maps. A
file descriptor needs to be obtained first for reference-counting purpose.

#### BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD

Once a program/map fd is acquired, an introspection tool can get the detailed
information from kernel about this fd, some of which are BTF-related. For
example, bpf_map_info returns btf_id and key/value type ids. bpf_prog_info
returns btf_id, func_info, and line info for translated bpf byte codes,
and jited_line_info.


#### BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID

With btf_id obtained in bpf_map_info and bpf_prog_info, bpf syscall command
BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID can retrieve a btf fd. Then, with command
BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD, the btf blob, originally loaded into the kernel
with BPF_BTF_LOAD, can be retrieved.

With the btf blob, bpf_map_info, and bpf_prog_info, an introspection tool
has full btf knowledge and is able to pretty print map key/values, dump
func signatures and line info, along with byte/jit codes.

## BPF Iterators

[BPF Iterators](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/bpf_iterators.html)

### Motivation

There are a few existing ways to dump kernel data into user space. The
most popular one is the /proc system. For example, cat /proc/net/tcp6
dumps all tcp6 sockets in the system, and cat /proc/net/netlink dumps
all netlink sockets in the system. However, their output format tends
to be fixed, and if users want more information about these sockets,
they have to patch the kernel, which often takes time to publish
upstream and release. The same is true for popular tools like ss
where any additional information needs a kernel patch.

To solve this problem, the drgn tool is often used to dig out the
kernel data with no kernel change. However, the main drawback for drgn
is performance, as it cannot do pointer tracing inside the kernel.
In addition, drgn cannot validate a pointer value and may read invalid
data if the pointer becomes invalid inside the kernel.

The BPF iterator solves the above problem by providing flexibility on
what data (e.g., tasks, bpf_maps, etc.) to collect by calling BPF programs
for each kernel data object.


### How BPF Iterators Work

A BPF iterator is a type of BPF program that allows users to iterate
over specific types of kernel objects. Unlike traditional BPF tracing
programs that allow users to define callbacks that are invoked at
particular points of execution in the kernel, BPF iterators allow
users to define callbacks that should be executed for every entry in
a variety of kernel data structures.

For BPF iterator programs, a bpf_link to the program is obtained using
bpf_link_create(), and the program callback is invoked by issuing
system calls from user space.


# bpf arena

## introduction

[bpf: Introduce BPF arena](https://lwn.net/Articles/961594/)

```
Introduce bpf_arena, which is a sparse shared memory region between the bpf
program and user space.

Use cases:
1. User space mmap-s bpf_arena and uses it as a traditional mmap-ed anonymous
   region, like memcached or any key/value storage. The bpf program implements an
   in-kernel accelerator. XDP prog can search for a key in bpf_arena and return a
   value without going to user space.
2. The bpf program builds arbitrary data structures in bpf_arena (hash tables,
   rb-trees, sparse arrays), while user space consumes it.
3. bpf_arena is a "heap" of memory from the bpf program's point of view.
   The user space may mmap it, but bpf program will not convert pointers
   to user base at run-time to improve bpf program speed.
```

[in-tree arena code comment](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ccb98ccef0e543c2bd4ef1a72270461957f3d8d0/kernel/bpf/arena.c#L13)


- pages shared between userspace mapping and kernel mapping

- page addition can be triggered from either userspace or kernel(bpf prog)

- userspace mmap() has to pass MAP_FIXED in case of multiple mmap(),
  all userspaces have to specifiy same mmap size


## BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY mmap example

Not find arena mmap example yet, but it is very similar with ARRAY's mmap
use.
