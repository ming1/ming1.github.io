# BPF verifier failure

## `Global function XXX() doesn't return scalar. Only those are supported.`


# Questions

## Does linux bpf allow to store pointer into map?

No, see [Q: Can BPF programs access instruction pointer or return address?](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/bpf_design_QA.html#q-can-bpf-programs-access-instruction-pointer-or-return-address)

[Long-lived kernel pointers in BPF](https://lwn.net/Articles/900749/)

But kptr annotated with KF_ACQUIRE can be transferred to map, see
kernelk funcs doc.

## how to understand and use kptrs?

### KF_ACQUIRE flag

> The KF_ACQUIRE flag is used to indicate that the kfunc returns a pointer
> to a refcounted object. The verifier will then ensure that the pointer
> to the object is eventually released using a release kfunc, or transferred
> to a map using a referenced kptr (by invoking bpf_kptr_xchg). If not, the
> verifier fails the loading of the BPF program until no lingering
> references remain in all possible explored states of the program.

Examples:
    - bpf_task_acquire() and bpf_task_release()

    - bpf_task_from_pid()

    - bpf_cgroup_acquire() and bpf_cgroup_release()

    - bpf_cgroup_from_id() and bpf_cgroup_ancestor()
