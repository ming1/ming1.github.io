# BPF verifier failure

## `Global function XXX() doesn't return scalar. Only those are supported.`


# Questions

## Does linux bpf allow to store pointer into map?

No, see [Q: Can BPF programs access instruction pointer or return address?](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/bpf_design_QA.html#q-can-bpf-programs-access-instruction-pointer-or-return-address)

[Long-lived kernel pointers in BPF](https://lwn.net/Articles/900749/)

But kptr annotated with KF_ACQUIRE can be transferred to map, see
`KF_ACQUIRE flag` section of [kernelk funcs doc](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/kfuncs.html)

## how to understand and use kptrs?

### KF_ACQUIRE flag

> The KF_ACQUIRE flag is used to indicate that the kfunc returns a pointer
> to a refcounted object. The verifier will then ensure that the pointer
> to the object is eventually released using a release kfunc, or transferred
> to a map using a referenced kptr (by invoking bpf_kptr_xchg). If not, the
> verifier fails the loading of the BPF program until no lingering
> references remain in all possible explored states of the program.

Examples:
    - bpf_task_acquire() and bpf_task_release()

    - bpf_task_from_pid()

    - bpf_cgroup_acquire() and bpf_cgroup_release()

    - bpf_cgroup_from_id() and bpf_cgroup_ancestor()

## BPF maps

```
BPF ‘maps’ provide generic storage of different types for sharing data
between kernel and user space. There are several storage types available,
including hash, array, bloom filter and radix-tree. Several of the map
types exist to support specific BPF helpers that perform actions based
on the map contents. The maps are accessed from BPF programs via BPF
helpers which are documented in the man-pages for bpf-helpers(7).

BPF maps are accessed from user space via the bpf syscall, which
provides commands to create maps, lookup elements, update elements and
delete elements. More details of the BPF syscall are available in
ebpf-syscall and in the man-pages for bpf(2).
```

### notes

- bpf map is global,

`bpf(BPF_MAP_CREATE, &attr, sizeof(attr))` returns one file descriptor for
this map.

Every process can access this map, include kernel.
