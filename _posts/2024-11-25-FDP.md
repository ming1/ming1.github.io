Flexible Data Placement Mode (FDP)

# Background

[Flexible Data Placement](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/news-events/tech-blog/flexible-data-placement/)

## WAF

Write Amplification Factor (WAF) is a ratio of the amount of data the SSD
actually has to manipulate to store data writes versus the amount of data
the host initially wrote. It starts out as a ratio of 1:1 for an empty drive
but gets worse over time as old data gets updated. Even if the host stays
well below the capacity of the drive, writing replacement data causes old
pages to be invalidated and their replacement data to be written elsewhere
– eventually filling up the drive and forcing old blocks to be erased and
reused.

## Block Erase.

The NAND storage in an SSD is internally organized by blocks and pages.
Typically, a block consists of several hundred pages. NAND can be written
on a page-by-page basis, but only erased at the block level – the whole
block must be wiped clean if any already-used page within it must be
updated or overwritten. Accordingly, when a host writes data to an SSD,
the SSD controller may need to read, erase, and then write back the data
multiple times in order to complete the operation.

## Garbage Collection.

As outdated data is replaced during these read - erase – write cycles,
and invalidated pages build up, the SSD controller orchestrates internal
garbage collection (GC) to reorganize pages and reuse blocks. Because
NAND blocks can only be erased and reused a limited number of times
before starting to fail, the controller does so in a way to spread out
block erasure evenly throughout the physical device. Nonetheless, without
directives from the host as to the lifetime of data it writes, it is
difficult for the SSD controller to minimize garbage collection. The more
frequent the GC, the more power is consumed, and the shorter the time
the drive will last.

## Superblock.

The SSD blocks physically reside in what is referred to as a Superblock.
These can be in a single NAND die or can span multiple NAND dice in the
same package, depending on the SSD architecture. Knowing how blocks align
to Superblocks is important to the host, because the host can organize
the data writes to avoid crossing Superblock boundaries.

Question: *relation between block and superblock?* 

## Data Placement.

A key means of reducing WAF and minimizing garbage collection is to
write pages in such a way that data is segregated, such as by static data
vs. data that will be updated frequently (cold vs. hot, or short vs.
long lifetime). If the host knows characteristics like this about the data,
then it can proactively ask the drive to place the data with like data
to reduce WAF as well as GC frequency.

## existed two approaches

The NVMe specification previously incorporated two methods to allow such
segregation.

### With Streams

The host specifies a stream number associated with each page of data to
be written. The controller then decides how and where to place this data
so that it is handled efficiently with other data of the same type. In
this method, the host has no direct control over physical placement within
the SSD, and is limited to a single namespace per stream.

### With Zoned Namespaces (ZNS)

The host specifies a zone within the SSD for each page of data to be
written. The overall host software task is complex with ZNS, requiring
that writes be sequential and therefore that the host “stage” random
data writes to make them appear to the drive as a sequential write. In
this method, the host has more direct control over the placement of data
within the SSD – but only at a Superblock level.

## FDP diagrams

### FDP Example: Disaggregated Storage

### NVMe™ Storage Entities

![Storage Entities](/assets/images/FDP_Storage_Entities.png)

- An FDP configuration consists of:

    -- One or more Reclaim Units (RUs)

    -- One or more Reclaim Groups (RGs)

    -- One or more Reclaim Unit Handles (RUHs) that reference to a Reclaim Unit in each RG

- An Endurance Group may supports one or more FDP configurations

- Write commands specify which RU to write the logical blocks by specifying:

    -- An RUH

    -- An RG

### Write to a Reclaim Unit

![Write to a Reclaim Unit](/assets/images/FDP_write_to_a_RU.png)

Controller looks up Placement Handle 1 in Namespace A and determines
to place the data using Reclaim Unit Handle 2 on Reclaim Group 0.

## FDP terms

### Reclaim Unit

- block?

### Endurance Group

- NVM Set?

### Reclaim Unit Handle

A Reclaim Unit Handle consists of a reference to a Reclaim Unit in each
Reclaim Group where user data from a write command is placed. A Reclaim
Unit referenced by the Reclaim Unit Handle is only allowed to be referenced
by at most one Reclaim Unit Handle. 

A controller resource that references a Reclaim Unit in each Reclaim Group

### placement handle

A namespace scoped handle that maps to an Endurance Group scoped Reclaim
Unit Handle which references a Reclaim Unit in each Reclaim Group.

Q: How to map LBA to **placement handle** and **RG**?

### Reclaim Group (RG)

An entity that contains one or more Reclaim Units


## FDP Features and Benefits

[Flexible Data Placement](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/news-events/tech-blog/flexible-data-placement/)

Flexible Data Placement removes the restrictions of Streams and ZNS by
introducing the concept of a Reclaim Unit, describing the physical part
of the SSD into which the host can direct the SSD to place data.

### Additional features are noteworthy.

- Unlike both ZNS and Streams, the host can place data from multiple
Namespaces in a single Reclaim Unit.

- Unlike ZNS, FDP allows data to be written both sequentially and randomly.

- FDP is more forgiving than the other approaches in that, if a host-issued
write command does not conform to the defined protocol, the drive completes
the write anyway and then logs the error. On the contrary, if a host issues
a write command to a ZNS namespace that crosses a zone boundary, or to an
invalid Stream, then the command is aborted and the data remains unwritten.

- A drive written in one server by FDP (or Streams) methods can be removed
and accessed by a server with no knowledge of the data segregation method.
On the contrary, an SSD written by ZNS methods may only be accessed by
another ZNS-capable server.

- To a greater degree than Streams or ZNS, FDP offers feedback information
from the drive by way of a channel for polling drive events and collecting
drive statistics.
