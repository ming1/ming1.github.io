# Motivation

## Thinking in AI

## Use AI for programming

- learn how to use AI for programming efficiently

- be familiar with one or two AI models for programming


## Use AI for making life easier

- build the practice to try AI first


## Multi-language support

- try to describe in english first

- if it can't be accurate, switch to native language


## AI is everywhere, what is your advantage?


# AI basics

# Use AI for programming

## Ask AI for patch review?

- post the patch to chat box directly

    - looks deepseek.com is pretty good at reviewing code

    - *how to request deepseek.com to review multiple patches?*

        - provide the whole patchset mbox message


## Ask AI to generate functions

### One example provided by AI(Cursor)

```
I need to create a function that processes user data in Python 3.8. The function should:
- Take a list of user objects as input
- Filter out inactive users
- Calculate average age
- Handle empty input lists
- Return a dictionary with results

Here's an example of the input data structure:
[{"name": "John", "age": 30, "active": true}, ...]

Expected output format:
{"avg_age": 25.5, "total_users": 10}
```

## Ask AI to write document or commit log

AI is good at writing document and commit log.

90% of the following commit is contributed by AI(Cursor):

[ublk: document auto buffer registration(UBLK_F_AUTO_BUF_REG)](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ff20c516485efbeb5c32bcb6aa5a24f73774185b)

## Ask AI to analyze kernel panic report

### deepseek can understand the panic log

- AI can try to think all related factors for this issue, which is helpful

- Follows one example:

[[bug report] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000001](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/CAGVVp+VN9QcpHUz_0nasFf5q9i1gi8H8j-G-6mkBoqa3TyjRHA@mail.gmail.com/)

## Ask AI to explain new patch or new kernel feature

### Deepseek(reasoning & internet) provides perfect answer

Example: 

```Can you explain a bit IOVA-based DMA API added to linux kernel recently?```

- 10 results are searched

- reasoning based on the 10 searches, and provide pretty good understanding
on the question.

# Use gemini API for coding assistence

## overview

## gemini-cli

[gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

- install

npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

cd your_project_top/

gemini

## use gemini API in python code directly

Google provides library to integrate gemini API directly, and allow to use
it in your application.


### patch review

- you just need to provide one link or pr, so no need to fetch the content
  manually

### write code

- pretty good at code refactoring

### issues

#### more memories, more mistakes

When less context left, mistakes rate is increased quickly.

When context left drops to 50%, please consider to drop current context
info.

#### communicate with agent like a human being

Guide and confirm.
