# Motivation

## Thinking in AI

## Use AI for programming

- learn how to use AI for programming efficiently

- be familiar with one or two AI models for programming


## Use AI for making life easier

- build the practice to try AI first


## Multi-language support

- try to describe in english first

- if it can't be accurate, switch to native language


## AI is everywhere, what is your advantage?


# AI basics

# Use AI for programming

## Ask AI for patch review?

- post the patch to chat box directly

    - looks deepseek.com is pretty good at reviewing code

    - *how to request deepseek.com to review multiple patches?*

        - provide the whole patchset mbox message


## Ask AI to generate functions

### One example provided by AI(Cursor)

```
I need to create a function that processes user data in Python 3.8. The function should:
- Take a list of user objects as input
- Filter out inactive users
- Calculate average age
- Handle empty input lists
- Return a dictionary with results

Here's an example of the input data structure:
[{"name": "John", "age": 30, "active": true}, ...]

Expected output format:
{"avg_age": 25.5, "total_users": 10}
```

## Ask AI to write document or commit log

AI is good at writing document and commit log.


## Ask AI to analyze kernel panic report

### deepseek can understand the panic log

- AI can try to think all related factors for this issue, which is helpful

- Follows one example:

[[bug report] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000001](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/CAGVVp+VN9QcpHUz_0nasFf5q9i1gi8H8j-G-6mkBoqa3TyjRHA@mail.gmail.com/)
