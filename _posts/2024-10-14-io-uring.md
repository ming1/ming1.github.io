io-uring notes

# **io-uring uses**

## IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN

### motivation

- [initial patchset](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/20220815130911.988014-1-dylany@fb.com/)

- defer async work until user space calls io_uring_enter with the GETEVENTS flag

- [avoid to overflow CQ queue](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/ab2d2f5c-0e76-44a2-8a7e-6f9edcfa5a92@gmail.com/)

- improve network workload perf

### usage

- require IORING_SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER

For DEFER_TASKRUN we require the completion task to be the same as the

submission task. This implies that there is only one submitter, so enforce that.
