# **io-uring uses**


## IOPOLL

- man page

```
IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL
       Perform  busy-waiting  for  an  I/O  completion, as opposed to getting notifications via an asynchronous IRQ (Interrupt Re‐
       quest). The file system (if any) and block device must support polling in order for this  to  work.  Busy-waiting  provides
       lower  latency,  but  may consume more CPU resources than interrupt driven I/O. Currently, this feature is usable only on a
       file descriptor opened using the O_DIRECT flag. When a read or write is submitted to a polled context, the application must
       poll for completions on the CQ ring by calling io_uring_enter(2).  It is illegal to mix and match polled and non-polled I/O
       on an io_uring instance.

       This is only applicable for storage devices for now, and the storage device must be configured for polling. How to do  that
       depends on the device type in question. For NVMe devices, the nvme driver must be loaded with the poll_queues parameter set
       to the desired number of polling queues. The polling queues will be shared appropriately between the CPUs in the system, if
       the number is less than the number of online CPU threads.

IORING_SETUP_HYBRID_IOPOLL
       This  flag  must  be  used  with  IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL flag. Hybrid io polling is a feature based on iopoll, it differs from
       strict polling in that it will delay a bit before doing completion side polling, to avoid wasting too much  CPU  resources.
       Like IOPOLL , it requires that devices support polling.

IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL
       When  this  flag is specified, a kernel thread is created to perform submission queue polling. An io_uring instance config‐
       ured in this way enables an application to issue I/O without ever context switching into the kernel. By using  the  submis‐
       sion  queue  to  fill in new submission queue entries and watching for completions on the completion queue, the application
       can submit and reap I/Os without doing a single system call.

       If the kernel thread is idle for more than sq_thread_idle milliseconds, it will set the IORING_SQ_NEED_WAKEUP  bit  in  the
       flags  field  of  the struct io_sq_ring.  When this happens, the application must call io_uring_enter(2) to wake the kernel
       thread. If I/O is kept busy, the kernel thread will never sleep. An application making use of this  feature  will  need  to
       guard the io_uring_enter(2) call with the following code sequence:

           /*
            * Ensure that the wakeup flag is read after the tail pointer
            * has been written. It's important to use memory load acquire
            * semantics for the flags read, as otherwise the application
            * and the kernel might not agree on the consistency of the
            * wakeup flag.
            */
           unsigned flags = atomic_load_relaxed(sq_ring->flags);
           if (flags & IORING_SQ_NEED_WAKEUP)
               io_uring_enter(fd, 0, 0, IORING_ENTER_SQ_WAKEUP);

       where sq_ring is a submission queue ring setup using the struct io_sqring_offsets described below.
```

```
man io_uring_enter()

       If  the  io_uring  instance  was  configured for polling, by specifying IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL in the call to io_uring_setup(2), then
       min_complete has a slightly different meaning.  Passing a value of 0 instructs the kernel to return any events which  are  already
       complete,  without  blocking.   If  min_complete  is  a non-zero value, the kernel will still return immediately if any completion
       events are available.  If no event completions are available, then the call will poll either until one or more completions  become
       available, or until the process has exceeded its scheduler time slice.

       Note that, for interrupt driven I/O (where IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL was not specified in the call to io_uring_setup(2)), an application
       may check the completion queue for event completions without entering the kernel at all.

```


## IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING

- man page

```
Registers a shared buffer ring to be used with provided buffers. This  is  a  newer  alternative
to  using  IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS which is more efficient, to be used with request types
that support the IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT flag.

The arg argument must be filled in with the appropriate information. It looks as follows:

     struct io_uring_buf_reg {
         __u64 ring_addr;
         __u32 ring_entries;
         __u16 bgid;
         __u16 pad;
         __u64 resv[3];
     };

The  ring_addr  field  must contain the address to the memory allocated to fit this ring.  The memory must be page aligned
and hence allocated appropriately using eg posix_memalign(3) or similar. The size of the ring is the product  of  ring_en‐
tries  and  the  size  of  struct io_uring_buf.  ring_entries is the desired size of the ring, and must be a power-of-2 in
size. The maximum size allowed is 2^15 (32768).  bgid is the buffer group ID associated with this ring. SQEs that select a
buffer have a buffer group associated with them in  their  buf_group  field,  and  the  associated  CQEs  will  have  IOR‐
ING_CQE_F_BUFFER  set  in  their flags member, which will also contain the specific ID of the buffer selected. The rest of
the fields are reserved and must be cleared to zero.

nr_args must be set to 1.

Also see io_uring_register_buf_ring(3) for more details. Available since 5.19.
```

```
/*
 * Flags for IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING.
 *
 * IOU_PBUF_RING_MMAP:  If set, kernel will allocate the memory for the ring.
 *                      The application must not set a ring_addr in struct
 *                      io_uring_buf_reg, instead it must subsequently call
 *                      mmap(2) with the offset set as:
 *                      IORING_OFF_PBUF_RING | (bgid << IORING_OFF_PBUF_SHIFT)
 *                      to get a virtual mapping for the ring.
 * IOU_PBUF_RING_INC:   If set, buffers consumed from this buffer ring can be
 *                      consumed incrementally. Normally one (or more) buffers
 *                      are fully consumed. With incremental consumptions, it's
 *                      feasible to register big ranges of buffers, and each
 *                      use of it will consume only as much as it needs. This
 *                      requires that both the kernel and application keep
 *                      track of where the current read/recv index is at.

## timeout multishot

```
       void io_uring_prep_timeout(struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,
                                  struct __kernel_timespec *ts,
                                  unsigned count,
                                  unsigned flags);

       IORING_TIMEOUT_MULTISHOT
              The  request  will return multiple timeout completions. The completion flag
              IORING_CQE_F_MORE is set if more timeouts are expected. The value specified
              in count is the number of repeats. A value of 0 means the timeout is indefinite
              and can only be stopped by a removal request. Available since the 6.4 kernel.

```


## IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN

### motivation

- [initial patchset](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/20220815130911.988014-1-dylany@fb.com/)

- defer async work until user space calls io_uring_enter with the GETEVENTS flag

- [avoid to overflow CQ queue](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/ab2d2f5c-0e76-44a2-8a7e-6f9edcfa5a92@gmail.com/)

- improve network workload perf

### usage

- require IORING_SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER

For DEFER_TASKRUN we require the completion task to be the same as the

submission task. This implies that there is only one submitter, so enforce that.


## IORING_SETUP_COOP_TASKRUN

```
IORING_SETUP_COOP_TASKRUN
       By default, io_uring will interrupt a task running in userspace when a completion event comes in. This  is  to  ensure
       that  completions  run  in a timely manner. For a lot of use cases, this is overkill and can cause reduced performance
       from both the inter-processor interrupt used to do this, the kernel/user transition, the needless interruption of  the
       tasks  userspace activities, and reduced batching if completions come in at a rapid rate. Most applications don't need
       the forceful interruption, as the events are processed at any kernel/user transition. The exception are  setups  where
       the  application  uses multiple threads operating on the same ring, where the application waiting on completions isn't
       the one that submitted them. For most other use cases, setting this flag will  improve  performance.  Available  since
       5.19.

IORING_SETUP_TASKRUN_FLAG
       Used  in  conjunction  with IORING_SETUP_COOP_TASKRUN, this provides a flag, IORING_SQ_TASKRUN, which is set in the SQ
       ring flags whenever completions are pending that should be processed. liburing will check for this flag even when  do‐
       ing  io_uring_peek_cqe(3)  and  enter  the  kernel  to process them, and applications can do the same. This makes IOR‐
       ING_SETUP_TASKRUN_FLAG safe to use even when applications rely on a peek style operation on the CQ ring to see if any‐
       thing might be pending to reap. Available since 5.19.
```

## Registered eventfd


## Read multishot

The  io_uring_prep_read_multishot(3) helper prepares an IO read multishot request. The submission queue
entry sqe is setup to use the file descriptor fd to start reading into a  buffer  from  the  provided
buffer group with ID buf_group at the specified offset.

nbytes must be set to zero, as the size read will be given by the size of the buffers in the indicated
buffer group IO.

On files that are not capable of seeking, the offset must be 0 or -1.

If nbytes exceeds the size of the buffers in the specified buffer group, or if nbytes is 0 , then the
size of the buffer in that group will be used for the transfer.

A multishot read request will repeatedly trigger a completion event whenever data is available to read
from the file. Because of that, this type of request can only be used with a file type that is pollable.
Examples of that include pipes, tun devices, etc. If used with a regular file, or a wrong file type in
general, the request will fail with -EBADFD in the CQE res field.

Since multishot requests repeatedly trigger completion events as data arrives, it must be used  with
provided  buffers.  With  provided buffers, the application provides buffers to io_uring upfront, and
then the kernel picks a buffer from the specified group in buf_group when the request is ready to
transfer data.

A multishot request will persist as long as no errors are encountered doing handling of  the  request.
For each CQE posted on behalf of this request, the CQE flags will have IORING_CQE_F_MORE set if the
application should expect more completions from this request.  If this flag isn't set, then that
signifies termination of the multishot read request.

## io_uring_buf_ring_add

The  io_uring_buf_ring_add(3)  adds a new buffer to the shared buffer ring br.  The buffer address is
indicated by addr and is of len bytes of length.  bid is the buffer ID, which will  be  returned  in  the
CQE. mask  is  the size mask of the ring, available from io_uring_buf_ring_mask(3).  buf_offset is the
offset to insert at from the current tail. If just one buffer is provided before the  ring  tail  is
committed  with io_uring_buf_ring_advance(3)  or  io_uring_buf_ring_cq_advance(3),  then buf_offset should
be 0. If buffers are provided in a loop before being committed, the buf_offset must be incremented by one
for  each  buffer added.

```
IOURINGINLINE void io_uring_buf_ring_add(struct io_uring_buf_ring *br,
                                         void *addr, unsigned int len,
                                         unsigned short bid, int mask,
                                         int buf_offset)
{
        struct io_uring_buf *buf = &br->bufs[(br->tail + buf_offset) & mask];

        buf->addr = (unsigned long) (uintptr_t) addr;
        buf->len = len;
        buf->bid = bid;
}

/*
 * Make 'count' new buffers visible to the kernel. Called after
 * io_uring_buf_ring_add() has been called 'count' times to fill in new
 * buffers.
 */
IOURINGINLINE void io_uring_buf_ring_advance(struct io_uring_buf_ring *br,
                                             int count)
{
        unsigned short new_tail = br->tail + count;

        io_uring_smp_store_release(&br->tail, new_tail);
}
```




## IOSQE_IO_LINK vs. IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK

```
liburing man page

IOSQE_IO_LINK
       When this flag is specified, the SQE forms a link with the next SQE in  the  submission  ring.  That
       next  SQE  will not be started before the previous request completes. This, in effect, forms a chain
       of SQEs, which can be arbitrarily long. The tail of the chain is denoted by the first SQE that  does
       not  have this flag set. Chains are not supported across submission boundaries. Even if the last SQE
       in a submission has this flag set, it will still terminate the current chain. This flag has  no  ef‐
       fect  on  previous SQE submissions, nor does it impact SQEs that are outside of the chain tail. This
       means that multiple chains can be executing in parallel, or chains and individual SQEs. Only members
       inside the chain are serialized. A chain of SQEs will be broken, if any request in that  chain  ends
       in  error. io_uring considers any unexpected result an error. This means that, eg, a short read will
       also terminate the remainder of the chain.  If a chain of SQE links is  broken,  the  remaining  un‐
       started part of the chain will be terminated and completed with -ECANCELED as the error code. Avail‐
       able since 5.3.

IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK
       Like  IOSQE_IO_LINK,  but  it doesn't sever regardless of the completion result.  Note that the link
       will still sever if we fail submitting the parent request, hard links  are  only  resilient  in  the
       presence  of  completion  results  for requests that did submit correctly. IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK implies
       IOSQE_IO_LINK.  Available since 5.5.
```

**The main difference is on how to advance the chain in case of parent request failure.**

## io_uring FD vs. SCM_RIGHTS

### io_uring FD can't be sent over SCM_RIGHTS

Commit: 705318a99a13 - "io_uring/af_unix: disable sending io_uring over sockets"

### SCM_RIGHTS

**SCM_RIGHTS** is a Socket Control Message (SCM) type that allows passing **file descriptors** between processes via Unix do  main sockets. This is the **only** mechanism in Linux for passing FDs between unrelated processes.

Understanding SCM_RIGHTS requires understanding the difference between:

1. **File Descriptor (int)**: Process-specific small integer (0, 1, 2, ..., N)
   - Lives in process's `files_struct->fdtable`
   - Just an index into a table
   - Process A's FD 5 ≠ Process B's FD 5

2. **struct file**: Kernel object representing an open file
   - Lives in kernel memory, reference-counted
   - Contains: file offset, flags, operations, inode pointer
   - **Can be shared** by multiple processes (via fork or SCM_RIGHTS)

```
Process A                     Kernel                    Process B
---------                     ------                    ---------
FD Table:                  struct file:               FD Table:
  [3] ─────────────────────→ refcount=2 ←─────────────  [7]
                             f_pos=1024
                             f_flags=O_RDWR
                             f_op=ext4_ops
                             f_inode=...
```
  
**SCM_RIGHTS doesn't "copy" the FD number. It shares the underlying `struct file`.**

- any `io_ring_ctx` is used in this task context, it will be tracked in this
`io_uring_task`

3) task_work:  ???

4) current->io_uring points to this structure

5) abstraction in task_struct side for io_uring, good point

  The Tracking Mechanism

  // cancel.c:599 - in io_uring_cancel_generic()
  if (!tctx_inflight(tctx, !cancel_all))   // cancel_all=false → tracked=true
      break;                                // Early exit if inflight_tracked == 0

  When io_uring_files_cancel() calls with cancel_all=false:
  - tctx_inflight(tctx, true) reads inflight_tracked
  - If inflight_tracked == 0 → breaks immediately, never calls io_uring_try_cancel_requests()

  When is REQ_F_INFLIGHT Set?

  io_req_track_inflight() is only called in two cases:

  // io_uring.c:1991-1992 - in io_file_get_normal()
  if (file && io_is_uring_fops(file))      // File is an io_uring instance
      io_req_track_inflight(req);

  io_uring_release()                    ← fput() on io_uring fd
    → io_ring_ctx_wait_and_kill()

  - tctx: NULL
  - Context: kworker thread (not submitter_task)
  - This is the path where the bug occurred with DEFER_TASKRUN

  2. io_uring_cancel_generic() - Task exit paths

  File: io_uring/cancel.c:612,619

  Called from two wrappers:

  2a. io_uring_files_cancel() - Early task exit

  do_exit()                             ← kernel/exit.c:896

        → io_uring_cancel_generic(false, NULL)
          → io_uring_try_cancel_requests(node->ctx, tctx, false, false)
  - tctx: current->io_uring
  - cancel_all: false (only cancel requests with files)

  2b. SQPOLL thread exit

  io_sq_thread()                        ← SQPOLL kthread
    → io_uring_cancel_generic(true, sqd)
      → io_uring_try_cancel_requests(ctx, tctx, true, true)

### comment

#### ublk requirement

1) support request submitted from multiple tasks which share one io_uring
context


#### callback prototype

```
1) io_uring_task_exit(unsigned long ctx_id, const struct task_struct *task)

2) API for checking uring command

io_uring_cmd_match(struct uring_cmd *cmd, unsigned long ctx_id, const struct task_struct *task)
```

#### delayed __fput()

```
1) io timeout is caused

2) one solution is to schedule exit work from do_exit()/__io_uring_cancel()

3) long delay is caused from:

io_uring_cancel_generic
	io_uring_clean_tctx
		io_wq_put_and_exit(wq);
			io_wq_exit_workers(wq);

4) how to solve it

- released resource in current task by io poll can be consumed by other
  pthreads immediately, so till may cause hang in current context

- why fallback work doesn't work?

- where is the timedout request submitted?

- why can't move exit_wq into exit_work()?
```

#### t/fio io_uring setttings

```
io_uring_setup():

          p->flags |= IORING_SETUP_CQSIZE;
          p->cq_entries = entries;
  
          p->flags |= IORING_SETUP_COOP_TASKRUN;
          p->flags |= IORING_SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER;
          p->flags |= IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN;
```

#### 2bc057692599 block: don't make REQ_POLLED imply REQ_NOWAIT

Then io_wq won't get -EAGAIN, but still may block because polling hold
requests without progress.


#### cancel_all

```
1) cancel_all is false

- called in do_exit(), each pthread or process? per-pthread, since the
  do_exit() is from kernel.

- when task->files are live yet

- pending task works

- there might be other ctx associated with tctx


2) cancel_all is true

- called in exec()

## io_kiocb double completion & link advancing in case of io-wq

1) request may be complete via task_work: 1st completetion

>
> ```
> static void io_req_complete_post(struct io_kiocb *req, unsigned issue_flags)
>     ...
> 	/*
> 	 * Handle special CQ sync cases via task_work. DEFER_TASKRUN requires
> 	 * the submitter task context, IOPOLL protects with uring_lock.
> 	 */
> 	if (ctx->task_complete || (ctx->flags & IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL)) {
> 		req->io_task_work.func = io_req_task_complete;
> 		io_req_task_work_add(req);
> 		return;
> 	}
>     ...
> ```

2) request completed via io_free_req(): final completion

> ```
> struct io_wq_work *io_wq_free_work(struct io_wq_work *work)
> {
> 	struct io_kiocb *req = container_of(work, struct io_kiocb, work);
> 	struct io_kiocb *nxt = NULL;
> 
> 	if (req_ref_put_and_test(req)) {
> 		if (req->flags & IO_REQ_LINK_FLAGS)
> 			nxt = io_req_find_next(req);
> 		io_free_req(req);
> 	}
> 	return nxt ? &nxt->work : NULL;
> }
> ```

Then the result is that the same request appears two times in `__io_submit_flush_completions`

BTW, for io-wq, link advancing is done in `io_wq_free_work()` or `io_queue_next()` from
`io_free_batch_list`, and it depends on where the refcount drops to zero in the
two code paths.

## Understand rsrc_node(v6.13)

- cover registered file & fixed buffer

resource lifetime management(buffer register/unregister vs buffer use)


## Understand io_uring buffers

### buffer register/unregister

```
io_sqe_buffers_unregister
   io_ring_ctx_free
    __io_uring_register 
    
``` 


### fixed buffer

- imported in ->prep()

- may be delayed to ->issue()

- managed by rsrc_node

- why can't be imported more than once in `io_uring/rw.c`?

### plain userspace buffer

- call io_import_iovec() directly in ->prep()

- why does vectored buffer have to be imported in the submission context?
-EFAULT is observed when importing uiov in io-wq context. But not observed
in case of io_uring_prep_read().

    EFAULT is returned from copy_iovec_from_user() <- iovec_from_user <-
    __import_iovec, and **copy_from_user()** can be only done in the submission
    conext

### selected buffer

#### overview


#### interface

##### io_kbuf_recycle

static inline bool io_kbuf_recycle(struct io_kiocb *req, unsigned issue_flags)

note:

1) usually for handling -EAGAIN

2) reset the buffer, so that it can be reused next time


##### io_put_kbuf

static inline unsigned int io_put_kbuf(struct io_kiocb *req, int len,
                                         unsigned issue_flags)

note:
1) called after data is read to this buffer

- **multishot can't be run from io-wq**


**comment in io_wq_submit_work()**

```
/*
 * If DEFER_TASKRUN is set, it's only allowed to post CQEs from the
 * submitter task context. Final request completions are handed to the
 * right context, however this is not the case of auxiliary CQEs,
 * which is the main mean of operation for multishot requests.
 * Don't allow any multishot execution from io-wq. It's more restrictive
 * than necessary and also cleaner.
 */
```


Reasons for the Restriction

1. DEFER_TASKRUN compatibility: When DEFER_TASKRUN is set, CQEs can only be posted from the submitter task context. Multishot
operations generate multiple auxiliary CQEs, which would violate this constraint if run from io-wq.
2. Cleaner design: The comment notes it's "more restrictive than necessary and also cleaner" - it simplifies the execution model.

What Happens Instead

When a multishot operation would be sent to io-wq, the kernel:
1. Checks if the file can be polled (io_file_can_poll())
2. If the file supports non-blocking operations (O_NONBLOCK or FMODE_NOWAIT), it arms a poll handler instead (io_arm_poll_handler())
3. The operation then runs via the poll mechanism rather than through io-wq

This ensures multishot operations always run in the appropriate task context where they can safely post multiple CQEs.



### data structures

#### io_poll_table

```
struct io_poll_table {
	struct poll_table_struct pt;
	struct io_kiocb *req;
	int nr_entries;
	int error;
	bool owning;
	/* output value, set only if arm poll returns >0 */
	__poll_t result_mask;
};
```

```
/*
 * structures and helpers for f_op->poll implementations
 */
typedef void (*poll_queue_proc)(struct file *, wait_queue_head_t *, struct poll_table_struct *);

/*
 * Do not touch the structure directly, use the access function
 * poll_requested_events() instead.
 */
typedef struct poll_table_struct {
	poll_queue_proc _qproc;
	__poll_t _key;
} poll_table;
```

#### buffer list flags

- REQ_F_BUFFER_RING

Purpose: Indicates that the request is using ring-provided buffers (not legacy buffers)

Usage:
- Set in io_ring_buffer_select() at kbuf.c:173 when selecting from a buffer ring
- Set in io_ring_buffers_peek() at kbuf.c:301 for peek operations
- Used in io_do_buffer_select() to determine if buffer selection is complete
- Cleared in io_kbuf_recycle_ring() during recycling

Key Behavior: Distinguishes between ring buffers (io_uring_buf_ring) vs legacy buffers (io_buffer list)


- REQ_F_BUFFERS_COMMIT

Purpose: Indicates that buffer ring head pointer needs to be incremented when the operation completes

Usage:
- Set alongside REQ_F_BUFFER_RING in io_ring_buffer_select() at kbuf.c:173
- Set in io_buffers_select() for peek operations at kbuf.c:323
- Checked in io_kbuf_commit() at kbuf.c:57 to determine if buffer advancement is needed
- Cleared after committing the buffer advancement in io_kbuf_commit() at kbuf.c:60

Key Behavior: Ensures buffer ring head advances after successful I/O completion to "consume" the buffer

                io_send_finish
                io_recv_finish
    io_net_kbuf_recyle
```

- REQ_F_BUFFER_SELECT

Purpose: Indicates that the request needs automatic buffer selection from provided buffers (user set via IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT)

Usage:
- Set by user via IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT SQE flag during prep
- Checked in various operations (net.c, rw.c, uring_cmd.c) to trigger buffer selection
- Used in io_do_buffer_select() to determine if buffer selection is needed
- Required for multishot uring_cmd operations

Key Behavior: Tells io_uring to automatically select a buffer before executing the operation


- REQ_F_BUFFER_SELECTED

Purpose: Indicates that a legacy buffer has been selected and assigned to req->kbuf

Usage:
- Set in io_provided_buffer_select() at kbuf.c:131 when selecting from legacy buffer list
- Used in io_do_buffer_select() to skip buffer selection if already done
- Checked in io_kbuf_recycle() to determine recycling path
- Used in cleanup (io_clean_op()) to trigger legacy buffer cleanup

Key Behavior: Marks that a legacy buffer is active and needs cleanup on completion

- REQ_F_BL_NO_RECYCLE

Purpose: Prevents buffer recycling/reclamation for the request (keeps buffers "consumed")

Usage:
- Set in io_buffers_select() for peek operations at kbuf.c:323
- Set in networking code (io_net_kbuf_recyle()) when buffers are already committed
- Set in read/write retry paths (rw.c:544, 607) to prevent buffer recycling on retry
- Checked in io_kbuf_recycle() at kbuf.h:138 to skip recycling

Key Behavior: Prevents buffers from being returned to the available pool, effectively "consuming" them


- Flag Combinations and Flow

Ring Buffer Selection Flow:
1. User sets IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT → REQ_F_BUFFER_SELECT
2. io_ring_buffer_select() → REQ_F_BUFFER_RING | REQ_F_BUFFERS_COMMIT
3. On completion → io_kbuf_commit() advances ring head
4. On recycle → io_kbuf_recycle_ring() clears flags

Legacy Buffer Selection Flow:
1. User sets IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT → REQ_F_BUFFER_SELECT
2. io_provided_buffer_select() → REQ_F_BUFFER_SELECTED
3. On completion → buffer returned to pool (unless REQ_F_BL_NO_RECYCLE)
4. On cleanup → io_kbuf_drop_legacy() frees buffer

Peek/Multi-buffer Operations:
1. io_buffers_select() → REQ_F_BUFFER_RING | REQ_F_BUFFERS_COMMIT | REQ_F_BL_NO_RECYCLE
2. Buffers are committed but not recycled (consumed permanently)

These flags work together to manage the complex buffer lifecycle in io_uring's
provided buffer system, handling both modern ring buffers and legacy buffer lists
efficiently.

### Contexts

#### io_arm_poll_handler() mechanism from AI

```
● The io_arm_poll_handler() mechanism is io_uring's way of handling asynchronous
I/O operations that can't complete immediately. Here's a detailed breakdown:

  Overview

  When an operation would block (like reading from a socket with no data), instead of
  sending it to io-wq, io_uring arms a poll handler that waits for the file descriptor
  to become ready.

  The Call Chain

  io_arm_poll_handler() → io_arm_apoll() → __io_arm_poll_handler()

  Step-by-Step Mechanism

  1. Initial Setup (io_arm_poll_handler() at poll.c:698)

  int io_arm_poll_handler(struct io_kiocb *req, unsigned issue_flags)
  {
      const struct io_issue_def *def = &io_issue_defs[req->opcode];
      __poll_t mask = POLLPRI | POLLERR;

      // Check if operation supports polling
      if (!def->pollin && !def->pollout)
          return IO_APOLL_ABORTED;
      if (!io_file_can_poll(req))
          return IO_APOLL_ABORTED;

  The function first determines what poll events to wait for based on the operation type:
  - Read operations: EPOLLIN | EPOLLRDNORM
  - Write operations: EPOLLOUT | EPOLLWRNORM
  - Always: POLLPRI | POLLERR for priority data and errors

  2. Async Poll Setup (io_arm_apoll() at poll.c:670)

  int io_arm_apoll(struct io_kiocb *req, unsigned issue_flags, __poll_t mask)
  {
      struct async_poll *apoll;
      struct io_poll_table ipt;

      mask |= EPOLLET;  // Always use edge-triggered
      if (!(req->flags & REQ_F_APOLL_MULTISHOT))
          mask |= EPOLLONESHOT;  // Single-shot unless multishot

      apoll = io_req_alloc_apoll(req, issue_flags);
      req->flags |= REQ_F_POLLED;
      ipt.pt._qproc = io_async_queue_proc;  // Callback for poll events

  Key aspects:
  - Edge-triggered polling: EPOLLET ensures we only get notified once per state change
  - Multishot support: For operations that can generate multiple events
  - Queue proc: io_async_queue_proc handles poll notifications

  3. Core Poll Handler (__io_arm_poll_handler() at poll.c:543)

  This is where the magic happens:

  static int __io_arm_poll_handler(struct io_kiocb *req,
                   struct io_poll *poll,
                   struct io_poll_table *ipt, __poll_t mask,
                   unsigned issue_flags)
  {
      // Set up ownership for concurrency control
      ipt->owning = issue_flags & IO_URING_F_UNLOCKED;
      atomic_set(&req->poll_refs, (int)ipt->owning);

      // Call into VFS layer to register poll
      mask = vfs_poll(req->file, &ipt->pt) & poll->events;

  Critical behavior:
  - vfs_poll(): Registers the request with the file's wait queue
  - Immediate ready check: If data is already available, returns immediately
  - Concurrency protection: Uses poll_refs to handle races between task_work and io-wq

  4. Poll Event Handling

  When the file becomes ready, the kernel's wait queue mechanism calls io_async_queue_proc():

  static void io_async_queue_proc(struct file *file, struct wait_queue_head *head,
                 struct poll_table_struct *p)
  {
      struct io_poll_table *pt = container_of(p, struct io_poll_table, pt);
      struct async_poll *apoll = pt->req->apoll;

      __io_queue_proc(&apoll->poll, pt, head, &apoll->double_poll);
  }

  This sets up the actual wait queue entry that will trigger when the file is ready.

  5. Task Work Execution

  When the poll triggers, io_poll_task_func() runs as task_work:

  void io_poll_task_func(struct io_kiocb *req, io_tw_token_t tw)
  {
      int ret = io_poll_check_events(req, tw);

      if (ret == IOU_POLL_NO_ACTION) {
          io_kbuf_recycle(req, 0);
          return;
      } else if (ret == IOU_POLL_REQUEUE) {
          // Re-arm for multishot
          __io_poll_execute(req, 0);
          return;
      }
      // Complete or reissue the original operation

  Key Design Principles

  Ownership Model

  - Task context: No ownership needed (serialized by running in same task)
  - io-wq context: Takes ownership to prevent races with task_work

  Multishot Support

  - For operations like recvmsg with MSG_WAITALL
  - Can generate multiple completion events from single submission
  - Uses REQ_F_APOLL_MULTISHOT flag

  Edge Cases

  - Spurious wakeups: Handled by re-checking conditions
  - Cancellation: Integrated with io_uring's cancellation system
  - Double polling: Some files may need multiple wait queues

  Why This Matters

  This mechanism allows io_uring to:
  1. Avoid blocking threads: No io-wq threads are consumed waiting
  2. Maintain task context: Completions run in the correct context for DEFER_TASKRUN
  3. Support complex operations: Like multishot receives and accepts
  4. Scale efficiently: Hundreds of thousands of polled operations with minimal overhead

  The poll handler is fundamental to io_uring's high-performance async I/O model, especially for network workloads where operations
  frequently need to wait for socket readiness.

### Questions

- how to cancel multishot request?

- does io_uring support multiple multishot requests? If yes, how to do it?

- what is the difference between REQ_F_MULTISHOT and REQ_F_APOLL_MULTISHOT?

## Add uring_cmd multishot support

[[PATCH] io_uring: uring_cmd: add multishot support without poll](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/20250810025024.1659190-1-ming.lei@redhat.com/)


### background

#### Pavel's implementation

[tx timestamp io_uring commands](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/cover.1745843119.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/#r)

#### why doesn't read_mshot work?

- poll() on multiple queue

- read_multishot() on multiple queue

    - make each queue as pollable device?

- is it possible for poll() to poll on multiple queue?

    - no, looks not, ->poll() can't recognize the current polling queue

### requirement

#### device interrupt event delivery

- needn't poll()

- triggered by io_uring API() directly


#### from AI

Please support multishot uring_cmd on linux io_uring, follows its user interface:

1) passing one multishot flag from e->uring_cmd_flags

2) only support selected or provided buffer, such as, pass buffer group id
from sqe->sqe->buf_group, and set IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT on sqe->flags.

The main use case is for delivering device event, such as interrupt event, to
userspace efficiently, and the event is stored to the selected buffer of
the multishot uring_cmd. Device can generate event automatically, so we
don't rely on device driver's poll() method, and REQ_F_APOLL_MULTISHOT
can't be set, so driver can just call io_uring uring_cmd APIs for getting
data. This way is similar with timeout multishot implementation.

For how to use provided buffer which is marked by IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT,
please refer to io_read_mshot() and io_recvmsg().

io_uring uring_cmd.c needs to provide two APIs to driver: one is for
selecting the buffer, another is for handling event completion, such as
posting CQE to io_uring completion queue, and updating the provide buffer.


### design

#### support .poll() for ublk char device

It doesn't work, because we need per-queue event, instead of device wide
event

Also "poll()" isn't necessary, also not efficient.

Here the model is hardware interrupt, and the usage is similar with timeout
multishot, however provided buffer is really needed.

#### steal timeout multishot implementation

- REQ_F_APOLL_MULTISHOT isn't needed

- support provided buffer

#### internal per-queue ring buffer for holding incoming request tag


### implementation

#### buffer lifetime issue from Jens

```
Final comment on this part... uring_cmd is unique in the sense that it'd
be the first potentially pollable file type that supports buffer
selection AND can return -EIOCBQUEUED. For non-pollable, the buffer
would get committed upfront. For pollable, we'd either finish and put it
within this same execution context, or we'd drop it entirely when
returning -EAGAIN.

So what happens if we get -EIOCBQUEUED with a selected buffer from
provided buffer ring, and someome malicious unregisters and frees the
buffer ring before that request completes?
```

#### typical selected buffer & pollable file


- io_read_mshot

```
io_read_mshot()
    ...
    if (ret == -EAGAIN) {
            /*
             * Reset rw->len to 0 again to avoid clamping future mshot
             * reads, in case the buffer size varies.
             */
            if (io_kbuf_recycle(req, issue_flags))
                    rw->len = 0;
            return IOU_RETRY;
    } else if (ret <= 0) {
```

```
io_queue_sqe
    io_queue_async
        io_arm_poll_handler
        io_kbuf_recycle
```

`IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER` means that the provided buffer is valid:

```
ret = IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER | (req->buf_index << IORING_CQE_BUFFER_SHIFT);
    __io_put_kbufs

```


#### unregister ring buffer

```
__io_uring_register(IORING_UNREGISTER_PBUF_RING)
    io_unregister_pbuf_ring
```

Once the provided buffer is unregistered, the uring OP may return with -ENOBUFS


## **How to support kernel buffer**

### motivation

- device zero copy

buffer is from kernel, and need to lease to io_uring for reading data to
the buffer, or writing data in the buffer.

It is like traditional copy_file_range() or splice() which can't support
to read data to the pages in pipe, also buffer ownership model isn't same.

[io_uring: support leased group buffer with REQ_F_GROUP_KBUF](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20241025122247.3709133-6-ming.lei@redhat.com/)

> ```
> This way looks a bit similar with kernel's pipe/splice, but there are some
> important differences:
> 
> - splice is for transferring data between two FDs via pipe, and fd_out can
> only read data from pipe, but data can't be written to; this feature can
> lease buffer from group leader(driver subsystem) to members(io_uring subsystem),
> so member request can write data to this buffer if the buffer direction is
> allowed to write to.
> 
> - splice implements data transfer by moving pages between subsystem and

> consume the leased buffer, so buffer lifetime is aligned with group leader
> lifetime, and buffer lifetime is simplified a lot. Especially the buffer
> is guaranteed to be returned back.
> 
> - splice can't run in async way basically
> ```

Also it has to be careful for dealing with reading data to the kernel buffer.
If the kernel buffer may be copied to userspace, the application has to be
trusted, that said the application has to read data to the buffer, otherwise
kernel data may be leaked to userspace.

### design

#### does it need to cover userspace buffer?

- such as, the buffer is originated from userspace, and it is provided
from one bpf OP(group leader)

- technically it is pretty easy to cover it

- at least it can be used for test purpose

#### how to make SQE group work with fixed kernel buffer?

- when to remove the registered buffer node?

  when the group leader is completed, one request flag of unregister
  buffer is used, buffer index is required

- is it possible to not introduce buffer index concept?

- local buffer

mark this buffer as **local buffer**, and local buffer is un-registered
automatically when its reference drops to zero

local buffer lifetime is same with sqe group's lifetime, or the buffer
table is local? auto-unregistered.

group leader owns the local buffer, only group member can use this local
buffer.

- buffer table

Any buffer is registered to the table, it becomes global visible for
everyone, it looks one big trouble now.


### questions

#### is faulted page for READ initialized as 0 before reading file data?


# Pavel Begunkov's io_uring bpf work

## [RFC v2 00/23] io_uring BPF requests Pavel Begunkov

[[RFC v2 00/23] io_uring BPF requests](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/cover.1621424513.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/)

### overview

```
The main problem solved is feeding completion information of other
requests in a form of CQEs back into BPF. I decided to wire up support
for multiple completion queues (aka CQs) and give BPF programs access to
them, so leaving userspace in control over synchronisation that should
be much more flexible that the link-based approach.
```

```
Summary:
The core idea is to allow BPF programs to be attached to io_uring, enabling them to process I/O request completions. This is
 achieved by introducing support for multiple completion queues (CQs) and providing BPF helper functions to submit and wait
for completion events. This would allow for more powerful and flexible I/O processing to be done directly in the kernel.

Overview:
The patch series aims to solve the problem of feeding I/O completion information back into BPF programs. By allowing BPF
programs to access io_uring's completion queues, developers can create sophisticated, kernel-level I/O processing pipelines.
 For instance, a BPF program could initiate a network read, and another BPF program could process the data as soon as it
arrives, all without leaving the kernel. This second version of the patch series (RFC v2) includes features like a new
IOURING BPF program type, helpers for data transfer between BPF and userspace, and support for sleepable BPF programs. The
changes are still under discussion and not yet merged into the mainline Linux kernel.

Part 2: BPF Integration

 * [PATCH 12/23] bpf: add IOURING program type
     * Summary: Defines a new BPF program type, BPF_PROG_TYPE_IOURING.
     * Overview: This patch officially introduces io_uring as a new subsystem that can host BPF programs.

 * [PATCH 13/23] io_uring: implement bpf prog registration
     * Summary: Adds the necessary syscall support for registering BPF programs with an io_uring instance.
     * Overview: Implements the glue code that allows a user to attach a BPF program to io_uring.

 * [PATCH 14/23] io_uring: add support for bpf requests
     * Summary: Introduces a new io_uring opcode, IORING_OP_BPF, for executing BPF programs.

 * [PATCH 15/23] io_uring: enable BPF to submit SQEs
     * Summary: Adds a BPF helper function that allows a BPF program to submit new io_uring requests.
     * Overview: This is a powerful feature that enables BPF programs to chain I/O operations, for example, starting a new
       read after a write completes.

 * [PATCH 16/23] io_uring: enable bpf to submit CQEs
     * Summary: Adds a BPF helper to allow BPF programs to directly post completion events (CQEs).
     * Overview: This allows BPF programs to signal completions to userspace or other BPF programs, enabling complex
       communication patterns.

 * [PATCH 17/23] io_uring: enable bpf to reap CQEs
     * Summary: Adds a BPF helper that allows a BPF program to consume completion events from a CQ.
     * Overview: This is the counterpart to submitting requests; it allows BPF programs to wait for and process the results of
        I/O operations.

 * [PATCH 18/23] libbpf: support io_uring
     * Summary: Adds support for the new IOURING program type to the libbpf library.
     * Overview: This makes it easier for developers to write and load io_uring BPF programs from userspace.

Part 3: Feature Enhancements

 * [PATCH 19/23] io_uring: pass user_data to bpf executor
     * Summary: Makes the user_data field from the submission queue entry available to the BPF program.
     * Overview: This allows userspace to pass a context-specific value to the BPF program, which is crucial for tracking
       requests.

 * [PATCH 20/23] bpf: Add bpf_copy_to_user() helper
     * Summary: Introduces a new BPF helper function, bpf_copy_to_user(), for writing data to userspace memory.
     * Overview: This is a generic BPF helper that will be used by io_uring to allow BPF programs to return data to the
       application.

 * [PATCH 21/23] io_uring: wire bpf copy to user
     * Summary: Integrates the bpf_copy_to_user() helper with the io_uring BPF infrastructure.
     * Overview: This patch makes the new helper available to io_uring BPF programs.

 * [PATCH 22/23] io_uring: don't wait on CQ exclusively
     * Summary: Modifies the waiting logic to not hold an exclusive lock on the completion queue.
     * Overview: A performance and correctness improvement to avoid deadlocks and improve concurrency when multiple entities
       (like BPF programs and userspace) are accessing the same CQ.

 * [PATCH 23/23] io_uring: enable bpf reqs to wait for CQs
     * Summary: Allows BPF programs to block and wait for a completion event on a specific CQ.
     * Overview: This is a key feature that enables stateful BPF programs that can wait for I/O to complete before proceeding.
        This requires the BPF programs to be "sleepable."

## BPF controlled io_uring

[[RFC v2 0/5] BPF controlled io_uring](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/cover.1749214572.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/)
[[PATCH v3 00/10] BPF controlled io_uring](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/cover.1763031077.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/)


### overview

```
This series adds io_uring BPF struct_ops, which allows processing
events and submitting requests from BPF without returning to user.
There is only one callback for now, it's called from the io_uring
CQ waiting loop when there is an event to be processed. It also
has access to waiting parameters like batching and timeouts.

It's tested with a program that queues a nop request, waits for
its completion and then queues another request, repeating it N
times. The baseline to compare with is traditional io_uring
application doing same without BPF and using 2 requests links,
with the same total number of requests.

# ./link 0 100000000
type 2-LINK, requests to run 100000000
sec 20, total (ms) 20374
# ./link 1 100000000
type BPF, requests to run 100000000
sec 13, total (ms) 13700

The BPF version works ~50% faster on a mitigated kernel, while it's
not even a completely fair comparison as links are restrictive and
can't always be used. Without links the speedup reaches ~80%.

This allows arbitrary relations between requests including using
a result from one request to configure the following one. There are
other use cases in mind that need access to in-kernel resources and
can't be implemented from userspace. On top, it can be extended with
more callbacks to get finer control over task work batching.

It's a prototype, I intend to remake the kfunc helpers, enchance
program verification, and fix some mild io_uring waiting edge
cases.

```

```
This patch set adds a hook into the io_uring waiting loop and
allows to attach a BPF program to it, which is implemented as
io_uring specific struct_ops. It allows event processing and
request submission as well as waiting tuning.

There is a bunch of cases collected over time it's designed to cover:

- Syscall avoidance. Instead of returning to the userspace for
  CQE processing, a part of the logic can be moved into BPF to
  avoid excessive number of syscalls.

- Smarter request ordering and linking. Request links are pretty
  limited and inflexible as they can't pass information from one
  request to another. With BPF we can peek at CQEs and memory and
  compile a subsequent request.

- Eventual deprecation of links. Linked request kernel logic is
  a large liability. It introduces a lot of complexity to core
  io_uring, and also leaking into other areas, e.g. affecting
  decisions on what and when is initialised. It'll be a big win
  if it can be moved into the new hook as a kernel function or
  even better BPF.

- Access to in-kernel io_uring resources. For example, there are
  registered buffers that can't be directly accessed by the userspace,
  however we can give BPF the ability to peek at them. It can be used
  to take a look at in-buffer app level headers to decide what to do
  with data next and issuing IO using it.

- Finer control over waiting algorithms. io_uring has min-wait support,
  however it's still limited by uapi, and elaborate parametrisation
  for more complex algorithms won't be feasible.

- Optimised waiting. On the same note, mixing requests of different
  types and combining submissions with waiting into a single syscall
  proved to be troublesome because of different ways requests are
  executed. BPF and CQE parsing will help with that.

- Smarter polling. Napi polling is performed only once per syscall
  and then it switches to waiting. We can do smarter and intermix
  polling with waiting using the hook.

It might need more specialised kfuncs in the future, but the core
functionality is implemented with just two simple functions. One
returns region memory, which gives BPF access to CQ/SQ/etc. And
the second is for submitting requests. It's also given a structure
as an argument, which is used to pass waiting information.

Previously, a test sequentially executing N nop request in BPF
showed a 50% performance edge over 2-nop links, and 80% with no
linking at all on a mitigated kernel.

since v2: https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/cover.1749214572.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/
  - Removed most of utility kfuncs and replaced it with a single
    helper returning the ring memory.
  - Added KF_TRUSTED_ARGS to kfuncs
  - Fix ifdef guarding
  - Added a selftest
  - Adjusted the waiting loop
  - Reused the bpf lock section for task_work execution

✦ This patch series, titled "BPF controlled io_uring," proposes a deeper integration between BPF and `io_uring by introducing 
  BPF struct_ops`.

  Summary:
  The core idea is to allow a BPF program to take control of the io_uring completion loop. Instead of a userspace application
  polling for I/O completions, a BPF program can be attached to the ring to process completion events directly within the
  kernel. This BPF program can then analyze the result of a completed operation and submit new io_uring requests without ever
  returning to userspace, significantly reducing overhead and latency.

  Overview:
  This patch series introduces a BPF-based callback that is invoked from io_uring's completion-waiting logic. This allows a
  BPF program to act as the "application logic" for I/O operations, running entirely in the kernel. The author provides
  benchmarks showing a potential performance improvement of 50-80% for certain workloads by avoiding the round trip to
  userspace. This enables the creation of highly efficient, in-kernel I/O processing pipelines, where one I/O operation can
  trigger the next in a chain, all managed by the BPF program. The series is presented as a prototype to gather feedback on
  the approach.

   * [PATCH 1/5] io_uring: add struct for state controlling cqwait
       * Summary: This patch refactors the completion queue (CQ) waiting logic by encapsulating its state into a new
         io_cq_wait_state structure.
       * Overview: This is a preparatory cleanup. By grouping all the variables related to waiting for completions (like
         timeouts and batch sizes) into a single structure, it becomes much easier to pass this context to an external function,
          which is exactly what's needed to call into a BPF program.

   * [PATCH 2/5] io_uring/bpf: add stubs for bpf struct_ops
       * Summary: This patch introduces placeholder (stub) definitions for the BPF struct_ops that will be used to control
         io_uring.
       * Overview: It lays the groundwork for the BPF integration by defining the function table (ops) that a BPF program will
         need to implement. This is the first step in defining the API between io_uring and the controlling BPF program.

   * [PATCH 3/5] io_uring/bpf: implement struct_ops registration
       * Summary: This patch adds the necessary logic to allow a BPF program, implementing the new struct_ops, to be registered
         with an io_uring instance.
       * Overview: This is the glue that connects the BPF world to the io_uring world. It allows a userspace application to load
          a BPF program and tell a specific io_uring ring to use that program for its completion handling.

   * [PATCH 4/5] io_uring/bpf: add handle events callback
       * Summary: This patch implements the core feature: it calls the registered BPF program from the io_uring completion loop.
       * Overview: When io_uring is about to wait for new completion events, it will now invoke the handle_events callback in
         the attached BPF program. The BPF program can then check for completed I/O, process the results, and submit new
         requests, effectively replacing the userspace application's event loop.

   * [PATCH 5/5] io_uring/bpf: add basic kfunc helpers
       * Summary: This patch exposes a set of io_uring kernel functions (kfuncs) to BPF programs.
       * Overview: To be useful, the BPF program needs to be able to interact with the io_uring instance it's controlling. This
         patch provides the necessary BPF helper functions to do things like peek at completion events, acquire submission queue
          entries, and submit new I/O requests from within the BPF program.

```

Looks this percpu data is freed.

### test description

- 'make test T=generic/002'

- can be triggered with get_data or without get_data


### use-after-free on 'io_uring_cmd' issue

- one usual problem

- posisoning io->cmd may figure out the reason


# **Idea: buffer abstraction & generic buffer**

## Use cases 
- one typical use case is for supporting io_uring bpf

io_uring exports kfunc for bpf prog, and buffer consumer is done as plugin,
which need to decouple OP implementation from buffer use

## Buffer operations

- setup

- teardown

- import

- recycle(?)


# **Idea: io_uring buffer export and import**

## Use cases

- zero copy support

- share buffer between user(producer) and consumer side

- borrow DMABUF's idea and framework

- export `buffer` in one io_uring instance to another io_uring, which
  imports the buffer

- file name is required

- in case of ublk, both frontend and backend share the same buffer, and
both frontend and backend need to use io-uring

- question: how to recognize the buffer in backend? physical address?

- something like modern io-uring's pipe? buffer can be page-less gpu
  buffer, or plain page buffer


# **add IORING_OP_BPF for extending io_uring**

## overview

[[PATCH 0/5] io_uring: add IORING_OP_BPF for extending io_uring](https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/20251104162123.1086035-1-ming.lei@redhat.com/)

## issues or improvements

### io_bpf_reg_unreg

What if one request isn't completed, however, the bpf prog is unregistered? 

Looks one real issue.


### export io_uring_bpf_feature flags for application

So that application knows which kfuncs can be ready to use.


### if `io_kiocb` needs to be visiable for bpf prog?


## TODO

### changes for V2

- support to access multiple fixed buffers in single bpf operations

req->buf_node

- fix reg/unreg bug

adding percpu_refcount

- add issue_wait()

add issue_wait() for offloading to io-wq

sleepable

meantime annotate issue() as non-sleepable

- sleepable annotation

kfunc()

struct_ops callback check in check_member()

- add builtin selftests

- pass buffer descriptors via bpf arena map

use bpf arena map to communicate between userspace and bpf prog

test code

- export bpf op features


### support vectored & fixed vectored buffer

### understand more bpf stuff

- struct_ops register & unregister

- bpf iterator map

- bpf arena map
