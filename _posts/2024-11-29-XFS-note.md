# Term

- AG:  Allocation group

- AGF: AG Free Space Block

- AGFL

The AG Free List is located in the 4th sector of each AG and is known as
the AGFL. It is an array of AG relative block pointers for reserved space
for growing the free space B+trees. This space cannot be used for general
user data including inodes, data, directories and extended attributes.

- AGI

Each AG manages its own inodes. The third sector in the AG contains
information about the AG’s inodes and is known as the AGI.

- CIL: Committed Item List

- AIL: Active Item List

## Getting to know the XFS file system

[Getting to know the XFS file system](https://www.ufsexplorer.com/articles/storage-technologies/xfs-file-system/)

### Basic structure of the file system

The file system itself can be divided into up to three separate parts:

#### Data section

The data section contains the metadata of the file system and the data of
user files.

-  allocation group (min: 16MB, max: 1TB)

Free extents in the allocation group are managed using a pair of B+ trees.
Their entries contain information about the starting block address of a
free-space region and its length in blocks. The first B+ tree is indexed by
the address value, whereas the second one – by the length value. 

- inode location

The locations of inodes within the allocation group are also indexed using
a B+ tree. Its records contain the offset for each 64-inode-chunk and a flag
for each inode within a chunk indicating whether it is in use.

- file extents

A similar approach is used to keep track of extents assigned to files. The
descriptor of each extent, besides its address and length in blocks, contains
the logical offset from the start of the file and a flag that characterizes
an extent as preallocated but not yet written to. Extent descriptors are
usually stored as a linear array embedded into the file’s inode. Yet, if
the number of extents is too large, they are indexed using another B+ tree,
whose root is located in the file’s inode.

- delayed allocation

XFS implements delayed allocation to improve write performance and reduce
file system fragmentation. A virtual extent is first built in the memory
and the appropriate amount of space is reserved for it in the file system.
However, the exact location of the data remains unknown until XFS makes
the decision to actually write it. Thus, some short-lived temporary files
might never get allocated to real blocks on the storage.


#### Log (journal) section

This area stores the modifications to the file system metadata. The entry
in the log for each structural item consists of header information that
describes it and a copy of the new image of this item as it should appear
on the disk. The entry is kept in the log until those changes are actually
committed to the data section. In case of a crash, the log can be read out
to complete the interrupted operations and restore the file system consistency.
This section can be located withing the data section itself or even externally
on a separate device for enhanced speed/reliability, depending on the
configuration.

[Ch14 journal log: XFS Algorithms & Data Structures 3rd](https://ftp.ntu.edu.tw/linux/utils/fs/xfs/docs/xfs_filesystem_structure.pdf)

The XFS journal exists on disk as a reserved extent of blocks within the
filesystem, or as a separate journal device. The journal itself can be
thought of as a series of log records; each log record contains a part of
or a whole transaction.

A transaction consists of a series of log operation headers (“log items”),
formatting structures, and raw data. The first operation in a transaction
establishes the transaction ID and the last operation is a commit record.
The operations recorded between the start and commit operations represent
the metadata changes made by the transaction. If the commit operation is
missing, the transaction is incomplete and cannot be recovered.


#### Real-time section

This optional section stores only the data of real-time files – ones with
special I/O speed requirements. It usually placed on a separate high-performance
storage device. The section is divided into a number of extents of a fixed size.
The allocation in it is performed in a more simple manner. It is managed with
the help of a linear bitmap, and the free space is indexed using a
two-dimensional array.

## Introduction to XFS Transaction Mechanism

[Introduction to XFS Transaction Mechanism](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/introduction-to-xfs-transaction-mechanism)

Modifying and updating metadata contents consists of three steps:


![XFS Transaction process](/assets/images/xfs_note_transaction_block.png)


### High level transactions: build CIL

- high level transactions are created to service a filesystem modification
request received through a system call (e.g. fallocate())

- Metadata items modified during servicing the system call are added to
a list owned by the high level transaction

- There could be several high level transactions executing at any given time.

- After completing all the required metadata modifications in memory, the
high level transaction is committed i.e The in-core metadata items owned by
the high level transaction are moved to a global list called
Committed Item List (CIL).

- Hence, The CIL consists of in-core metadata items that were modified and
committed by one or more high level transactions.

### Checkpoint transactions

- These transactions process metadata items present in the CIL

- The following actions are performed by a Checkpoint transaction once
sufficient number of metadata items have accumulated in the CIL

    - Format each in-core metadata in the CIL to a metadata specific
    in-core structure.

    - Formatted structures are written to the the on-disk log

    - The corresponding in-core metadata are then moved to the Active
    Item List (AIL).

### xfsaild: update on-disk structure

- wakes up at regular intervals to process in-core metadata that were
added to AIL

- It copies the contents from fields of modified in-core metadata
structures over to the on-disk structures.

- The updated on-disk structures is then written to the disk.

`man xfs`

### data section

The data section contains all the **filesystem metadata (inodes, directories,
indirect blocks)** as well as the **user file data** for ordinary  (non-realtime)
files and **the log area** if the log is internal to the data section.  The
data section is divided into a number of allocation groups.  The number and
size of the allocation groups are chosen by mkfs.xfs(8) so  that  there  is
normally  a small  number  of  equal-sized  groups. The number of allocation
groups controls the amount of parallelism available in file and block
allocation.  It should be increased from the default if there is sufficient
memory and a lot of  allocation  activity.  Then number of allocation groups
should not be set very high, since this can cause large amounts of CPU time
to be used by the filesystem, especially when the filesystem is nearly full.
More allocation groups are added (of the original size) when xfs_growfs(8)
is run.

### log section

The  log  section  (or  area,  if  it  is  internal to the data section) is
used to **store changes to filesystem metadata while the filesystem is running
until those changes are made to the data section**.  It is written **sequentially**
during  normal  operation and **read only during mount**.  When mounting a
filesystem after a crash, the log is read to complete operations that were
in progress at the time of the crash.

### realtime section

The  realtime  section  is used to **store the data of realtime files**.  These
files had an attribute bit set through xfsctl(3) after file creation, before
any data was written to the file.  The realtime section is divided into a
number of extents  of  fixed  size (specified  at mkfs.xfs(8) time).  Each
file in the realtime section has an extent size that is a multiple of the
realtime section extent size.

### AG

Each allocation group contains several data structures.  The first sector
contains the superblock.  For  allocation  groups  after the  first,  the
superblock  is just a copy and is not updated after mkfs.xfs(8).  The next
three sectors contain information for block and inode allocation within
the allocation group.  Also contained within each allocation group are
data structures to locate free blocks and inodes; these are located
through the header structures.

- superblock:                   sector 0

- block/inode allocation info:  sector 1 ~ 3

- data structures for locating free blocks and inodes

# XFS Design & implementation

## [XFS Delayed Logging Design](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.12/filesystems/xfs/xfs-delayed-logging-design.html)

### Preamble

- overview of transactions in XFS

- how transaction reservations are structured and accounted

- how we guarantee forwards progress for long running transactions
with finite initial reservations bounds.

- how relogging works

- the design of the delayed logging mechanism

### Introduction

XFS uses **Write Ahead Logging** for ensuring changes to the filesystem
metadata are atomic and recoverable. For reasons of space and time
efficiency, the logging mechanisms are varied and complex, combining
**intents, logical and physical logging** mechanisms to provide the
necessary recovery guarantees the filesystem requires.

- Some objects, such as inodes and dquots

Logged in logical format where the details logged are made up of the
changes to in-core structures rather than on-disk structures. 

- Other objects - *typically buffers* -

Have their physical changes logged. 

- Long running atomic modifications

Have individual changes chained together by *intents*, ensuring that
journal recovery can restart and finish an operation that was only
partially done when the system stopped functioning.

The logging subsystem only cares that certain specific rules are followed
to guarantee **forwards progress and prevent deadlocks.**


### Transactions in XFS

XFS has two types of high level transactions, defined by the type of
log space reservation they take. These are known as “one shot” and
“permanent” transactions. Permanent transaction reservations can take
reservations that span commit boundaries, whilst “one shot” transactions
are for a single atomic modification.

- one-shot transaction pattern 

```
tp = xfs_trans_alloc(<reservation>)
<lock items>
<join item to transaction>
<do modification>
xfs_trans_commit(tp);
```

As items are modified in the transaction, the dirty regions in those
items are tracked via the *transaction handle*. Once the transaction is
committed, all resources joined to it are released, along with the
remaining unused reservation space that was taken at the transaction
allocation time.

- permanent transaction

```
tp = xfs_trans_alloc(<reservation>)
xfs_ilock(ip, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL)

loop {
        xfs_trans_ijoin(tp, 0);
        <do modification>
        xfs_trans_log_inode(tp, ip);
        xfs_trans_roll(&tp);
}

xfs_trans_commit(tp);
xfs_iunlock(ip, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL);
```

While this might look similar to a one-shot transaction, there is an
important difference: `xfs_trans_roll()` performs a specific operation
that links two transactions together:

```
ntp = xfs_trans_dup(tp);
xfs_trans_commit(tp);
xfs_trans_reserve(ntp);
```

This results in a series of “rolling transactions” where the inode is
locked across the entire chain of transactions. Hence while this series
of rolling transactions is running, nothing else can read from or write
to the inode and this provides a mechanism for complex changes to appear
atomic from an external observer’s point of view.

It is important to note that a series of rolling transactions in a
permanent transaction does not form an atomic change in the journal.
While each individual modification is atomic, **the chain is not atomic**.
If we crash half way through, then recovery will only replay up to
the last transactional modification the loop made that was committed to
the journal.

This affects long running permanent transactions in that it is not
possible to predict how much of a long running operation will
actually be recovered because there is no guarantee of how much of
the operation reached stale storage. Hence if a long running operation
requires multiple transactions to fully complete, the high level
operation must use intents and deferred operations to guarantee
recovery can complete the operation once the first transactions is
persisted in the on-disk journal.

### Transactions are Asynchronous

In XFS, all high level transactions are asynchronous by default.
This means that xfs_trans_commit() does not guarantee that the
modification has been committed to stable storage when it returns.
Hence when a system crashes, not all the completed transactions
will be replayed during recovery.

- global ordering guarantees

However, the logging subsystem does provide **global ordering guarantees**,
such that if a specific change is seen after recovery, all metadata
modifications that were committed prior to that change will also be seen.

- Synchronous transaction & 'log force'

For single shot operations that need to reach stable storage immediately,
or ensuring that a long running permanent transaction is fully committed
once it is complete, we can explicitly tag a transaction as synchronous.
This will trigger a “log force” to flush the outstanding committed
transactions to stable storage in the journal and wait for that to complete.

Synchronous transactions are rarely used, however, because they limit
logging throughput to the IO latency limitations of the underlying storage.
Instead, we tend to use log forces to ensure modifications are on stable
storage only when a user operation requires a synchronisation point to
occur (e.g. fsync).


### Transaction Reservations

Logging subsystem needs to provide a forwards progress guarantee so
that no modification ever stalls because it can’t be written to the
journal due to a lack of space in the journal. This is achieved by
the transaction reservations that are made when a transaction is
first allocated. For permanent transactions, these reservations are
maintained as part of the transaction rolling mechanism.

A transaction reservation provides a guarantee that there is physical
log space available to write the modification into the journal before
we start making modifications to objects and items. As such, the
reservation needs to be large enough to take into account the amount
of metadata that the change might need to log in the worst case. This
means that if we are modifying a btree in the transaction, we have to
reserve enough space to record a full leaf-to-root split of the btree.
As such, the reservations are quite complex because we have to take
into account **all the hidden changes that might occur**.


- One example of fallocate()

For example, a user data extent allocation involves allocating an
extent from free space, which modifies the free space trees. That’s two
btrees. Inserting the extent into the inode’s extent map might require
a split of the extent map btree, which requires another allocation
that can modify the free space trees again. Then we might have to update
reverse mappings, which modifies yet another btree which might require
more space. And so on. Hence the amount of metadata that a “simple”
operation can modify can be quite large.

- reservation for oneshot transaction

For one-shot transactions, a single unit space reservation is all that
is required for the transaction to proceed. For permanent transactions,
however, we also have a “log count” that affects the size of the
reservation that is to be made.


- permanent transaction

While a permanent transaction can get by with a single unit of space
reservation, it is somewhat inefficient to do this as it requires the
transaction rolling mechanism to re-reserve space on every transaction
roll. We know from the implementation of the permanent transactions
how many transaction rolls are likely for the common modifications
that need to be made.

For example, an inode allocation is typically two transactions - **one
to physically allocate a free inode chunk on disk, and another to
allocate an inode from an inode chunk that has free inodes in it.**
Hence for an inode allocation transaction, we might set the reservation
log count to a value of 2 to indicate that the common/fast path
transaction will commit two linked transactions in a chain. Each
time a permanent transaction rolls, it consumes an entire unit
reservation.

### Log Space Accounting




### re-logging

XFS allows multiple separate modifications to a single object to be
carried in the log at any given time. This allows the log to avoid needing
to flush each change to disk before recording a new change to the object.
XFS does this via a method called “re-logging”.

Conceptually, this is quite simple - **all it requires is that any new change
to the object is recorded with a new copy of all the existing changes in the
new transaction that is written to the log**.

**Each time an object is relogged, the new transaction contains the
aggregation of all the previous changes currently held only in the log.**

```
Transaction             Contents        LSN
   A                       A               X
   B                      A+B             X+n
   C                     A+B+C           X+n+m
   D                    A+B+C+D         X+n+m+o
    <object written to disk>
   E                       E               Y (> X+n+m+o)
   F                      E+F             Y+p
```
