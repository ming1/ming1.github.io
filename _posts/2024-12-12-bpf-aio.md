bpf aio idea

* TOC
{:toc}


# Requirement

## Interface
- provide aio interface for bpf prog(so far, ublk is main user), but any
kernel component which has IO logic may benefit from bpf aio

## Use cases

- fs aio

- tcp socket aio

    - not like fs aio, tcp socket is byte stream orinted, so two SEND IOs have
    to be submitted in order, and usually only one RECV IO can be in-progress

    - but it should be possible to share same aio interface with fs aio

    - cover UDP socket?

- others?

# Design
## FS aio design

- only submitted in specified user context, and user passes FD from map
to prog, and bpf prog tries to build & submit kiocb in current context first
with IOCB_NOWAIT; If -EAGAIN is returned, switch to submit this aio in kernel
wq context

- when the aio is completed, user-defined aio completion callback is called,
and the callback is defined by bpf struct_ops

## TCP socket aio design

- one bpf_map is required for storing the current aio link


# Ideas

## Does `aio_ctx` need to defined?

## Can bpf aio prog be attached/detached in generic way?
